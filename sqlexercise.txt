--INSTRUCTIONS:
--Navigate to the following -----------
--It is an open Data Base provided by w3schools.
--If you do not see the tables at the left side of the screen, you may need to click [Restore DB] to retrieve the list of tables.

--LIST OF EXERCISES
--1.	Select all employees who have any degree in “BA”.  // I assume higher degrees should not be considered as demanded in this task
--2.	Display how many orders were processed by each employee. Display Employees Last Name, First Name and amount of orders;
--3.	Display how many orders were made by each Shipper. Display Shipper's name and "Amount of processed orders".

--Answers:

--1-	Question 1:

		SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Notes LIKE '% BA %';	--I may prefer this one in case of another existence like BALTIMORE University etc...

--2-	Question 2:

        SELECT employees.firstname, employees.lastname, COUNT(orders.orderID) AS ORDERQTY
        	FROM employees
            JOIN orders
            ON employees.employeeid=orders.employeeId
            GROUP BY employees.employeeId;


		SELECT T1.LastName, T1.FirstName, (SELECT COUNT(EmployeeID) FROM Orders AS T2 WHERE T1.EmployeeID=T2.EmployeeID) AS NumberOfOrders
		FROM Employees AS T1 ;

--3-	Question 3:
	--a.	If existence in Order Table means processed
	            ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                SELECT Shippers.shippername, count(orders.orderId) AS ProcessedOrders
                                                    FROM orders

                ---------------------------------------------------------------------
		        SELECT T1.ShipperName, (SELECT COUNT(OrderId) FROM Orders AS T2 WHERE T1.ShipperID=T2.ShipperID) AS ProcessedOrders

                                    ORDER BY T1.ShipperName ASC;
